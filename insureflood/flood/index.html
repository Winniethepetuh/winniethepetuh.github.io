                            <span>Who Provides Flood Insurance?</span> <br>

                            There are two primary actors who provide flood insurance. <br>
                            <br>

                            <div class="for__program about__bar_features">
                              <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The National Flood Insurance Program, a federally backed program, created by Congress in 1968 to provide 
                                    building owners with access to flood insurance. The NFIP is administered by Federal Emergency Management 
                                    Agency (FEMA) and is sold to consumers either directly by FEMA or through Write Your Own (WYO) companies. 
                                    WYO companies are private insurers who just administer the policies (and take a fee for doing so) but do not take 
                                    any of the risk. The coverages and rates are all standardized, they are all exactly the same. There are about 80 WYO 
                                    companies offering FEMA’s NFIP program under their brand
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Private insurance companies who take on the risk themselves (not the government). This is referred to as Private 
                                    Market insurance. Previously, very few private insurance companies were willing to provide flood insurance, for 
                                    several reasons. The risk of financial loss was too great. They did not have data needed to properly underwrite risks. 
                                    They could not compete with the NFIP who provided rates that are below actuarially sound (hence such a large 
                                    deficit in the NFIP program – over $30 Billion – ouch). With all sorts of data now available, and with NFIP having 
                                    had raised rates and continue to raise rates, private carriers are selectively competing. Each Private Market carrier has a 
                                    different risk appetite, geographical area where they want to write business, and has its own set of rates. Most 
                                    policies mimic the NFIP policy and some offer enhancements and higher limits.
                                </li>
                              </ul>
                            </div> <br>

                            <span>How is premium calculated?</span> <br>

                            The NFIP has specific rating structure that is made available to the public.  The main criteria is the zone the building 
                            is in, the type of building (whether there is a basement) and the buildings Base Flood Elevation (BFE) measurement.  
                            BFE shows how the water is predicted to rise during a flood event compared to the elevation of the building.  In 
                            critical flood zones, the NFIP requires an elevation certificate (issued by a surveyor or engineer stating buildings 
                            various elevations to sea level). <br>
                            <br>

                            Private Market insurers have proprietary modeling, but in general they all look to calculate their exposure to flooding 
                            using historical flooding data, elevation data, trends, building resiliency measures and are not limited to guidelines 
                            that handcuff the NFIP. <br>
                            <br>

                            <span>Flood Zones</span> <br>

                            FEMA has specific description of each zone here https://www.fema.gov/flood-zones#.
                            In a nutshell zones B, C and X are your Moderate to Low Risk Areas.  Zones A and V are High Risk Areas.  If the 
                            building is in a zone A or V and has a mortgage, the lender will require flood insurance.
                            It’s important to note flood zones are continuously being remapped and many of the zones in use now are outdated 
                            and do not reflect the true risk of flooding.  Check your BFE, that’s your key measure of risk. <br>
                            <br>

                            <span>Grandfathering</span>

                            When FEMA changes zone maps into a High Risk Area, some properties continue to pay rates to the NFIP based on 
                            the current Moderate or Low Risk Area map.  The rate is “grandfathered.” <br>
                            <br>

                            <span>Why is the NFIP/FEMA raising flood insurance premiums?</span> <br>

                            Property owners in low and moderate risk areas were subsidizing the rates for properties in high hazard areas.  After 
                            Hurricane Katrina, FEMA went into substantial debt (and more so after Sandy, Irma, Harvey) and Congress voted to 
                            phase out some of the premium subsidies.  The idea was to make property owners pay their fair share of the risk. <br>
                            <br>

                            <span>Flood Mitigation</span> <br>

                            For FEMA’s NFIP, there are only a handful mitigation measures that affect insurance premiums: increase building’s 
                            elevation; create flood openings on buildings foundation so floodwaters can flow through, filling in a basement or 
                            crawl space, and wet flood proofing, as needed; and raising mechanical equipment out of the basement. <br>
                            <br>

                            <div class="for__program about__bar_features">
                              <ul>
                                <li>Elevate your home – yes, literally raise your home.  Lift the home and build a new foundation that is higher.  This is an expensive process but once done it drastically reduces the flood risk and thus flood premiums.  This puts the home above anticipated flood levels so it should not get flooded again.</li> <br>
                                <li>Raise your mechanicals – This option won’t reduce your insurance premiums much with the NFIP but private insurers love it. Put your equipment where it won’t get flooded.</li> <br>
                                <li>Fill in your basement/crawlspace – Yes, literally fill it up with materials such as sand. Not a favorite for many, but it raises the buildings loweSavest floor elevation without lifting the house. You may need to also install flood vents to reduce damage to your home’s structural foundation.</li> <br>
                                <li>Install flood vents – Effective and one of the least expensive options.   Risk of damage is reduced from flood water by allowing it to flow through.  Water can flow in and out of the vents thus reducing pressure that may otherwise cause structural damage to walls and foundation.</li> <br>
                                <li>Install a backwater valve – This won’t save money with NFIP but you will be glad you got it. Sewer systems overflow and wastewater can flow backward through drainpipes back to the buildings. Once installed, a backwater valve closes when sewage tries to get back into your building.</li> <br>
                                <li>Get rid of your carpet for tiles – If your basement has carpet, replace it with tiles. Clean up will be easier and you’ll prevent a few inches of flood water from doing major damage.</li> <br>
                                <li>What about a sump pump? Sump pumps help to drain seepage and water. Get that water out of there.</li><br>
                                <li>Upgrade with water damage resistant materials. There is a myriad of materials that is water resistant.</li><br>
